Pauli Van Wyk lives everyday under
the weight of her own lies and
propaganda about EFF and VBS. It is
her wettest dream to see the black
people unrepresented. She is a relic of
apartheid Media. She has now become
the victim of her own propaganda and
far from reality.

id you know?Jews started the ANC.
African National Congress - ANC
In 1963 a group of Jews founded the
Legendary Jewish Heroes of Black Rule in South
Africa Stamps
""African"" National Congress. The
ANC was founded by Lionel
4500
#75
Bernstein, Bob Hepple, Dennis
Goldberg, Arthur Goldreich, Hazel
Goldreich and James Kantor, with a
few African front men - Nelson
Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan
Baruch Hirson
Weinberg
Mbeki (father of Thabo Mbeki),
Raymond Mhlaba, and Ahmed
75
Kathrada. In this, the ANC followed
the model the Jews established
when they founded the NAACP in the
United States, with the exception
that the ANC was a much more
Ester Barsel
Hymie
violent and openly communist
organization. These Jews and their
#75
African National Congress received
funding and support from both the
Soviet Union and the US CIA.
In particular, Ruth First, the Jewish
wife of Jewish Soviet KGB Colonel
Hilda Bernstein
Helen Suzman
(Gavronsky)
Joe Slovo, a leader of the South
25
African Communist Party, was
primarily responsible for funneling
funds to this ""African"" National
Congress.
In 1966 the CIA financed the
Lionel ""Rusty"" Bernstein
Norma Kitson
assassination of President
Verwoerd, through their ""lone nut""
4500
operative Demetrio Tsafendas, a
Greek immigrant to South Africa. In
particular, Oppenheimer's South
African Foundation funneled CIA
money to Hendrik Van Den Bergh of
Ray Alexander
the South African Security Police
Ronald Segal
and John Vorster, the Minister of
4500
Justice, who were the men who
recruited Tsafendas to assassinate
Verwoerd.

to subvert South Africa was having

Now it makes sense why the

They were promised a seat at the
Government of National Unity after running
around screaming ""not stronger together""
when the Springboks were winning world

The IEC system did not just crash, but
it was deliberately and systematically
aborted. What the public doesn't know
is that MK was at 55 % nationally, when
this was done. There's evidence that
Bheki Cele was at the IEC server room
when this happened.

Alleged vote rigging of Votes / Elections
2024
Assessment / conclusion /
Next steps?
Here's evidence that the number of
votes written on the VD National results
sheets at this VD at Letsete Secondary
School, Matjhabeng, Free State, does
not correspond with the number of votes
captured in the @IECSouthAfrica NPE
Results locator.
!!
Assessment of evidence:
1. VD 22600404 National Results Sheet
(Image 1 - assumption- - taken by a party
agent on a mobile phone):
1.1. ANC - 238
1.2. Check the time stamp and date to verify
authenticity of the image
2. VD 22600404 NPE Results located /
National
(Image 2)
2.1. ANC 614
Conclusion:
!! IEC data capturing awarded the ANC 376
more National votes at VD 22600404
!! ANC awarded 257.98% more votes at VD
22600404
Provided that the authenticity of image 1
can be verified by date stamp and / the
original results sheet
If this is one VD, in my opinion it casts doubt
on the integrity of the IEC's vote counting",0,tweet

Dear IEC Admin,
I would like to lodge a dispute about the electronic counting system which in
our view doesn't make sense as the overall percentage reflected doesn't tally
with our numbers collected by party agents and elections centres especially
in KZN.
You will recall that we did request the information regarding the IT service
providers you appointed, which would have helped us do due diligence about
them and the system they would have used thereof.
In this regard, we have come to the conclusion that we demand the manual
counting immediately, especially in KZN, Gauteng and Mpumalanga.

INJEJE CONDEMNS THE BRIBES ACCEPTED BY IEC COMMISSIONER DR. NOMSA
MASUKU & IEC CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER MS DAWN MBATHA FROM CYRIL
RAMAPHOSA & THE DA PARTY TO RIG THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL GENERAL
ELECTIONS
KWAMFIHLOZOMHLABA The Information Sourcing Unit (ISU) of the INJEJE yabeNGUNI Council through
our BRICS sympathizers have received impeccable evidence that IEC Commissioner Dr. Nomsa Masuku
and IEC Chief Financial Officer Ms. Dawn Mbatha have both been bribed by Cyril Ramaphosa and DA
leaders to rig the South African National General Elections in favor of the ANC and the DA.
Evidence points to the fact that Dr. Masuku will receive a brand-new luxury vehicle and a large cash
injection in the region of millions and Ms. Dawn Mbatha will get a new fully furnished house and a large
cash injection in the region of millions
In light of the new evidence, INJEJE gives both Dr. Nomsa Masuku and Ms. Dawn Mbatha to resign from
the positions within 24 hours failing which our INJEJE will be compelled to expose publicly far more
than they would like the public to know.

Read carefully the words of Dr Imtiaz Suliman and ensure that each one
of us reflect and vote justly and wisely on Wednesday
A Vote for Humanity.
October 7 paved the way for reflection and introspection of the human
psyche. The behaviour of individuals, professional associations,
communities, religious groupings, political parties and governments was
made manifest. Realisation dawned that the survival of mankind
depended on the humanity of these groupings. The world divided itself
into an unintended Coalition for the Good on the one hand, that stood
for what was humane and just, and on the other hand there were
organized groupings that performed backflips to support seventy six
years of torture, injustice, occupation, displacement, dehumanization
and finally genocide. This grouping was the collective manifestation of
Imperialism, Colonialism, Materialism and Zionism.",0,tweet

This is the same woman accused by
Congolese politicians for enabling
rigging of elections in DRC in favour of
Felix Tshisekedi. The same Tshisekedi
who is clandestinely rewarding ANC
principals with mining gigs in the
DRC. The same Tshisekedi who has
influenced the deployment of SANDF
in DRC, not for peacekeeping but to
protect commercial interests of ANC
principals.
To conceal the thuggery, they are
keeping Congolese preoccupied with
anti Kagame propaganda.
The tone of the IEC and attitude
towards MK Party tell a tale of an
Electoral Commission that is not

The IEC few hours ago released
a controversial media statement
claiming, ""Videos are being circulated
on social media by supporters of the
MK Party.""
This statement is highly problematic,
inaccurate, and could potentially
compromise the impartiality of
the IEC. Even IFP spokesperson
@MkhulekoHlengwa shared the
video, as well as members of various
other political parties. By insinuating
that only the MK Party is responsible
for circulating these videos, the
@IECSouthAfrica is disseminating false

This response to this incident has been

suspicions about possible political

MEDIA RELEASE
Statement from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)
The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) wishes to inform the public that a number
of fake polls are currently circulating on social media, spread by influential accounts. A
recent poll attributed to the newspaper The Citizen has been brought to our attention; it
presents particularly surprising and unverified results concerning the voting intentions
of various political parties.
We remind all citizens that the dissemination of fake polls is an illegal practice under
South African law. Section 89 of the Electoral Act clearly states that the publication and
dissemination of false or misleading information aimed at influencing the electoral
process are strictly prohibited and punishable by law.
The IEC warns voters against these deceptive practices and urges them to exercise
caution. We encourage all citizens to refer only to official and reliable sources of
information for accurate and verified data on voting intentions and election results.
In this crucial period, it is essential to maintain the integrity and transparency of our
electoral process. The IEC continues to closely monitor the situation and will take
appropriate action against any person or organization involved in the dissemination of
false electoral information.
We urge all voters to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious or misleading
information to the IEC. Together, we can ensure free, fair, and transparent elections for
the future of our country.

One of the greatest influences in my life has been the German
Confessing Church Gaint, #DietrichBonhoeffer, who was executed by
the Nazi's, for his outspoken resistance to Adolf Hitler. The words of
Bonhoeffer that: ""Silence in the face of evil, is itself evil"", became my
guiding motto, and I refused to remain silent, despite huge personal cost.
I urge all my fellow South Africans also not to remain silent and
complacent now, in the face of the #EvilANC. The elections of the 29th
of May give you a voice, use that power wisely, and speak out: Unplug

99 percent of the real estate

Zionists in WesternCape... All the
illegal store owners who pay
double/ triple rent above market to
the Zionists... We are coming to
check the landlords of all the Tuck

why are there so many illegal
immigrants in the Western Cape
with no hesitation? You will

Why Zionists are protecting illegal

Dear Mr. Mbalula,
I trust this email finds you well.
My name is Dr. Ivan Meyer. and am reaching out to you on behalf of the Democratic Alliance (DA). As you are
aware our party has long been committed to fostering dialogue and collaboration across political lines for the
betterment of South Africa. With this in mind, I am writing to propose a meeting between the leadership of the DA
and the African National Congress (ANC), specifically between our leader, John Steenhuisen, and President Cyril
Ramaphosa
We believe that there are significant opportunities for cooperation between our two parties on key issues facing our
country Both the DA and the ANC share a commitment to addressing the pressing challenges of unemployment
poverty. inequality and corruption By engaging in constructive dialogue, we can explore areas of common ground
and work towards meaningful solutions that benefit all South Africans
A meeting between Mr. Steenhuisen and President Ramaphosa would provide an important platform for
discussing potential areas of collaboration and exploring the feasibility of forming a coalition government We
understand the complexities involved in such discussions and are committed to approaching them with openness
respect, and a genuine desire to serve the interests of the people of South Africa
We are flexible regarding the timing and format of the meeting and are prepared to accommodate the schedules
of all parties involved Whether it be an in-person meeting or a virtual discussion we are confident that meaningful
dialogue can take place.
We kindly request your assistance in facilitating this meeting and would be grateful for any support you can provide
in coordinating schedules and logistics.
Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your response and to the opportunity to engage in
productive discussions with our counterparts in the ANC
Yours sincerely,
Stroy

won't be free and fair as IEC shows their biases.
The Land Party urges the people of South Africa to stand up against the
compromised IEC, the Oppenheimer's and the Americans are meddling
in our elections, but South Africans are quiet.

BREAKING NEWS: IEC claims it's
impossible to RIG elections, this is an
attempt to force the public to lower
their guard.
The IEC is aware of more than 2 million
fraudulent ID's belonging to illegal
foreigners which automatically proves
the rigging of elections, they have made
it clear that they are unable to trace and
remove all fraudulent IDs.
The ANC government through the
High Court ruled out that ""It is
unconstitutional to block fraudulent
IDs"", this forms part of the rigging of
election.

He presented me with a download link
to a form off SASSA's website. I printed
it out and helped him fill it in. I was
astonished to read on SASSA's website
that no more than six people can apply
for Foster Child Grant per child. Six
people, I asked? How can six people
apply for a care grant for one child. But
wait, let me explain you qualify for the
grant if you look after a child for more
than three days in a month-cycle or say
you look after a specific child for three
or more days in a month.
You do not need to supply an ID, a birth
certificate or even a passport to access
the grant; you simply have to fill in the
form and have it signed by your pastor.
There are many 'pastors' willing to sign
their names on a document for a fee.

namely Helen Zille and Thomas Walters, convened with
Lennit Max of the Freedom Front Plus (FF PLUS) and Ph

party President Mzwanele Nyhontsho and his mooted

they remain opposed to any party that subscribes to
the Freedom Charter as the ""betrayal"" in 1955 and in
the 1990s (during CODESA) stems from it.

he is still a member of the African National Congress and he will not for it but
for the MK party instead. This clearly indicates that there is no difference
between the MK party and the ANC. Any talks with the MK party are as the
Office 203. 2nd Floor,
same as talking to the ANC and therefore we cannot have talks with the MK

party and not have talks with the ANC because we believe that the two parties

RE
Deputy-Secretary General: PAC
: THE PAC REJECTS NYONTSHO'S VISIT TO INKANDLA
Revolutionary Greetings
We as the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania have noted with great concern and shock
the visit of Mr Mzwanele Nyontso who claims to be the president visit to Inkandla
(Mr Jacob Zuma's compound) where we are told that discussions on cooperation were
discussed
1. We hereby distance the PAC of Azania from this visit the touted unity talks, we
remain diametrically opposed to any party that subscribes and promotes the
sell-out document called ""Freedom Charter"" as is the case with the MK party
and its leaders We remain convinced that our betrayal both in 1955 and 1990's
stems from the Freedom Charter.
2. At the core of our struggle as the PAC remains the land which was, and
continues to be prostituted by the Freedom Charter which has been entrenched
in the country's constitution with its most reactionary and deceiving line which
says ""South Africa belongs to all who live in it, both black and white"" thus
declaring our country a no-man's land

Article by Gaynor Ungerer
Before I start my rant of disbelief and shock, let me first familiarize you
with the current SASSA grants available to citizens, foreigners, and
refugees.
There are nine grants managed by SASSA, namely the Care Dependency
Grant, the Child Support Grant, the Disability Grant, the Foster Child
Grant, the Grant In-Aid, the Older Person Grant, the Social Relief Grant,
the War Veterans Grant, and the Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress.
For this exercise, we will be focusing on how the Child Support Grant
(R480 + R240 CSG) in conjunction with the Foster Child Grant (R1 050)
enables six non-citizen adults and four children to draw a combined R38
520.00 each month.
I was approached earlier this week by one of the locals in my area,
requesting me to help him with paperwork for his wife to enable her to
claim from SASSA. He has two wives, one that lives with him here in the
winelands and another who lives in town. He has one child per wife and
is not legally married to either. He also has a brother that lives here in the
winelands, and his wife is back in Zimbabwe.
She visited South Africa a year ago, heavily pregnant, and left to go back
to Zimbabwe once her daughter was born. Little did I know that she
came here specifically to give birth for the sole purpose of accessing the
grants.
These babies are known as ""anchor babies"".
They also have a 'brother' in the winelands who also has a wife and a
child. Voila! Six Adults, four children. He presented me with a download
link to a form off SASSA's website. I printed it out and helped him fill it in.
I was astonished to read on SASSA's website that no more than six
people can apply for Foster Child Grant per child. Six people, I asked?
How can six people apply for a care grant for one child. But wait, let me
explain ... you qualify for the grant if you look after a child for more than
three days in a month-cycle or say you look after a specific child for",0,tweet

THEY TRIED TO KILL YOU BEFORE, WHY WOULDN'T THEY NOW?
In South Africa, many born frees are overly trusting of white politicians
because they are foolish and don't read history. As a result they don't
realize that for decades white leadership had a program to create
#KaffirKiller diseases and Saimr even went as far as vaccinating black
people with HIV through doctors and clinics, hence the high HIV rate in
SA.
Many of those doctors are still practicing today and their prominence will
grow if DA gets anywhere close to national power. EFF will give power to
DA, so #VoteANC

like we did with SAIMR during apartheid. Vote DA.""

Thank you for the attack piece you did on DG, Lamati last week. It went well.
Now that we have established some level of trust, I am sending you more information extracted from the investigation,
but not in the report I sent you. This will help you have impactful article this coming Sunday.
Please keep my possible involvement out, because for a month no one leaked anything.
You'll receive the balance of your payment after the publishing of the story.

No. It's called a Soros colour revolution

did the same and even boasts about
it in South Africa which resulted in the
deaths of many White people who were
just Farmers leading to a Civil War.
Then with the white farm owners dead
the land was given to the citizens. Only
one problem. None of them knew how
to farm so they suffered huge famine
and once again the Government blamed
the ""white people"" for not teaching
them Agriculture. Where do they think
